# Browser Spotlight Search - Chrome Extension

## Project Vision
Create a Chrome extension that functions as a spotlight search for the web browser, providing instant access to files across various cloud storage platforms. The extension will offer a unified search interface that indexes and searches through user's files, similar to macOS Spotlight but for cloud-based documents and files.

## Core Functionality
- **Universal Search**: Quick command/shortcut to open a search overlay within any web page
- **File Indexing**: Index files from connected cloud storage services
- **Instant Results**: Real-time search results as user types
- **Quick Actions**: Direct file opening, sharing, and basic file operations
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Support for multiple cloud storage providers

## Initial Scope (MVP)
Start with Google Drive integration:
- Authenticate with Google Drive API
- Index files and folders from user's Google Drive
- Provide search functionality across file names, content (where possible), and metadata
- Enable quick opening of files in appropriate applications/browser tabs

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Plasmo (Next.js-based Chrome extension framework)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for Google Drive
- **Storage**: Chrome extension storage for cached file metadata
- **UI**: Modern, clean interface with keyboard navigation support
- **APIs**: Google Drive API v3 for file access and metadata

## User Experience Goals
1. **Speed**: Sub-second search results
2. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support
3. **Context-Aware**: Remember recent searches and frequently accessed files
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Overlay that doesn't interfere with current web page
5. **Intuitive**: Familiar spotlight-like interface

## Key Features
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Quick activation (e.g., Cmd+K or Cmd+Space)
- **Smart Search**: Search by filename, content, file type, modification date
- **File Preview**: Quick preview of document content where possible
- **Recent Files**: Easy access to recently opened/modified files
- **File Type Filtering**: Filter results by document type (docs, sheets, pdfs, etc.)
- **Fuzzy Search**: Intelligent matching even with typos or partial names

## Future Expansion (Post-MVP)
- OneDrive integration
- Dropbox integration
- Local file system integration (with permissions)
- Advanced file operations (rename, move, delete)
- Collaborative features (shared files, team drives)
- AI-powered content search and summarization
- Custom file organization and tagging

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Efficient indexing strategy to minimize API calls
- **Security**: Secure token storage and handling
- **Privacy**: Local storage of file metadata, no server-side data storage
- **Offline Support**: Cached results when possible
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement smart caching
- **Cross-Browser**: Initially Chrome, with potential Firefox support later

## Success Metrics
- Search response time < 500ms
- High user engagement (daily active usage)
- Successful file access rate
- User satisfaction with search accuracy
- Minimal resource usage impact on browser performance

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic Plasmo setup and Google Drive authentication
2. **Phase 2**: File indexing and basic search functionality
3. **Phase 3**: UI/UX implementation with keyboard shortcuts
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and caching
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced search features and file preview
6. **Phase 6**: Testing, refinement, and preparation for additional integrations

## Target Audience
- Knowledge workers who frequently access cloud-stored documents
- Students with extensive Google Drive usage
- Professionals managing large numbers of files across cloud platforms
- Anyone seeking faster access to their digital files while browsing

This extension aims to bridge the gap between local file access speed and cloud file convenience, making digital file management as seamless as possible within the browser environment.
